LD4Sensors is a Web service that supports the average user in annotating sensor and sensor-related data while using the SPITFIRE ontology and following both the Linked Data principles and previously identified best-practices. Its major goal is to lower the learning costs that are usually an entry barrier for applying Linked Data and using semantic technologies; so that any kind of user could benefit from the creation of Linked Sensor Data. This becomes increasingly relevant as the sensor users market broadens, spanning any age and country. To achieve this goal, LD4Sensors
(a) automates the creation of RDF descriptions from the raw information submitted by clients, (b) automates the creation of links (included in the RDF descriptions) with data from the LOD cloud, which can be easily customized, rated and commented, (c) splits the data items according to their dependency and where they should be stored, and (d) exposes both a usable RESTful API and a Graphical User Interface. The Linked Data descriptions generated by LD4Sensors can be shared in social network communities, are unambiguous and schema-independent. These features are critical
to enable plug-and-play sensor nodes interoperability among different sensors.
